# Introduction

A personal blog that will be use mainly to write about things that I do such as my thougt process when I'm building something. I am using Nuxt Content as my starter template, [Nuxt Content documentation](https://content.nuxt.com). I'm trying to achieve CMS-like with this blog.

## Setup

```bash
bun run dev
```
